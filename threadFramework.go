// EXPERIMENTAL: WorkerExtension allows you to register an external worker where instead of calling frankenphp handlers on
// frankenphp_handle_request(), the ProvideRequest method is called. You are responsible for providing a standard
// http.Request that will be conferred to the underlying worker script.
//
// A worker script with the provided Name and FileName will be registered, along with the provided
// configuration. You can also provide any environment variables that you want through Env. GetMinThreads allows you to
// reserve a minimum number of threads from the frankenphp thread pool. This number must be positive.
// These methods are only called once at startup, so register them in an init() function.
//
// When a thread is activated and nearly ready, ThreadActivatedNotification will be called with an opaque threadId;
// this is a time for setting up any per-thread resources. When a thread is about to be returned to the thread pool,
// you will receive a call to ThreadDrainNotification that will inform you of the threadId.
// After the thread is returned to the thread pool, ThreadDeactivatedNotification will be called.
//
// Once you have at least one thread activated, you will receive calls to ProvideRequest where you should respond with
// a request. FrankenPHP will automatically pipe these requests to the worker script and handle the response.
// The piping process is designed to run indefinitely and will be gracefully shut down when FrankenPHP shuts down.
//
// Note: External workers receive the lowest priority when determining thread allocations. If GetMinThreads cannot be
// allocated, then frankenphp will panic and provide this information to the user (who will need to allocate more
// total threads). Don't be greedy.
